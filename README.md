Totpy
=========================
Mobile authenticator for generating one-time passwords based on [TOTP Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc6238.txt.pdf).  
Compatible desktop version of this app is also available: [totpy-desktop-authenticator](https://github.com/FilipBlazekovic/totpy-desktop-authenticator).  

Tokens for one-time passwords are protected using asymmetric key pair (RSA or EC) stored in device's secure hardware (StrongBox or TEE).

Supports:

- protection of tokens using screen lock credentials (mandatory)
- remotely deleting tokens by sending an SMS message containing a predefined phrase (additional protection in case a device gets stolen)
- sorting tokens based on category (work, personal, email, ...)
- search based on token category, issuer or account
- adding tokens by scanning a QR code, entering OTPAuth URI, or manually entering values for required token parameters
- exporting tokens to a file protected by a password or second authenticator's asymmetric key
- importing tokens from a locked export file

2. select tokens you wish to export and click on the export button on the bottom of the UI
3. select "Protect with public key" option in the popup dialog that appears by pressing a button to scan the public key from a QR code, or a button to load a public key from a file
